## **Description:**

Project "Bookshop" was created for comfortable using the service of searching books.
Many apps and online bookshops are difficult to use, and this project solves their problem.

## **Technologies:**

It was made with Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Java Core, OOP, Docker, Maven, Git and SQL.

## **Controllers:**

There are controllers, that allow to search books by specific parameters, add books to the shopping cart,
search categories, make an order and also register a user, and log in.
Also there are others for creating a book, changing the status of an order, and adding a category that is allowed for admins only.

## **For people:**

People using GitHub can pull my project and make some corrections, improve the project, or use it for their goal.

## **Problems:**

Making a "Book shop" I faced to make order functionality and authentication.
I correctly built relations between entities and wrote a service part regarding what had to be at the order level.
Regarding authentication, I found another programmers' sollutions and remade a functionality on my way.
